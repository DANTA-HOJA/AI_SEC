## Configuration Settings Examples (.toml)

```text
A series of .ipynb notebooks to demonstrate the valid inputs for configurations.

for example:

script_dl/2.training/2.a.vit_b_16.py <-> script_dl/Config/2.training.toml
script_dl/4.test_by_fish/4.a.vit_b_16.py <-> script_dl/Config/4.test_by_fish.toml
...
